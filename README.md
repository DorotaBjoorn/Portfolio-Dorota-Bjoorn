# Dorota Bjöörn MSc, PhD:

Welcome to my student repo at IT-högskolan were I study to become AI and Machine Learning engineer (Aug 2022-May 2024)

I am an experienced project manager with a background primarly in product development within medical technology and cutting tools. The main focus in my roles has been to create an environment which enables my team members to perform at their best. I am good at listening, creating clear structures, motivating others and communication. I am result- and solution oriented and put my efforts where I can craete value. I am also curious and always interested in expanding my knowledge, which has led me to study AI and machine learning. I am very excited about this new step and I hope to pursue my career at a dynamic company with a strong innovative culture and clear team sprit, where I can make a difference.
<br/><br/>
Recently I spent a few weeks as an intern in industry. My assignment was on applying Machine Learning techniques to diverse aspects of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including clustering, classification, and labeling. The main focus was analysis of domain-specific, non-annotated text, working with concepts such as BERT-models, clustering techniques, zero-shot classification, and active learning. This hands-on experience contributed to the ongoing development, bringing ideas closer to tangible products​
