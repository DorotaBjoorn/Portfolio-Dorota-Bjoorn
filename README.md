# Dorota Bjöörn MSc, PhD:

Welcome to my student repo at IT-högskolan were I study to become AI and Machine Learning developer (Aug 2022-May 2024)

I am an experienced Project Manager mainly from product development within medical technology and also cutting tool development. The main focus in my role is always creating a well functioning team and an environment enabling my team members to perform at their best. I am good at listening, creating clear structures, motivating and communication. I am result- and solution oriented. I am also curious and always interested in learning new things, which has now led me to study again. I am very excited about this new step where I hope to soon pursue my career in a dynamic company with a strong innovative culture and clear team sprit, where I can make a difference.
