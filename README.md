# Dorota Dahlborg MSc, PhD:

Welcome to my student repo at IT-University (ITHS) where I studied AI and Machine Learning (Aug 2022-May 2024).

I am an engineer and experienced project manager with a background in product development within medical technology and cutting tools. My main focus has always been to create an environment, which enables my team members to perform at their best. I am good at creating clear structures, motivating others and communication. I am result- and solution oriented and put my efforts where I can create most value. I am also curious and always interested in expanding my knowledge, which has led me to study AI and machine learning. I am very excited about this new step and eager to transition my career into the tech industry, where I want to make a real difference.
<br/><br/>
My studies of AI and ML at IT-University were a good complement to my theoretical background as an engineer and were very hands-on, which suited me well. From my studies I have experience with cleaning and preparing both image and text data with for example Pandas, Spacy, NLTK; building and evaluating models in frameworks such as TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, scikit-learn for ML and Deep ML (from scratch or with transfer learning). I have also experience in Data Engineering: ELT/ETL, CI/CD with GitHub Actions, Docker and pipelines in Airflow. During my internships I focused mainly on text data, for example analysis of domain-specific, non-annotated text, working with concepts such as BERT-models, unsupervised clustering and labeling techniques, zero-shot classification, and active learning. Futhermore I have extensively explored potential of small LLMs and various strategies to constrain and structure their output. Finally I have finetuned models for custom object detection (Paliscope property). This hands-on experience contributed to the ongoing development, bringing ideas closer to tangible products​.
